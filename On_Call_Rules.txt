2. On Friday 12:30 PM we hand over the duty to the next person in the rotation.
3. You need to configure the notifications for messages or calls that you need to attend without DND. If you are on DND mode also you need to setup your notifications to bypass that.
4. Know your schedule when you are going to be in the on call duty. Mark dates in the calendar so it will remined you.
5. While you are handing over your duty to the other person summarise the issues that you faced during your on call in the slack channel. And also go to the slack channel once if your going to be the on call person to get a view about the things what is happening around.
6. Need to address every issue that is going to come in the form of alerts. Need to raise a ticket for every issue. And also check all the platforms like jira, sensu and datadog, slack channel to know that every thing is addressed.
7. You need to be aware of the cloud maintenance, filter the mails coming from cloud providers so that you will not miss any mail regarding the maintenance. Notify the maintenance to the team through channel.
8. Client issues. Take a look of the issue and create a ticket based on the impact. Send a mail to the team so they will be aware of the ticket. If needed create a new channel in the slack with the ticket number. Update all changes in the ticket. 
9. If you want to escalate a ticket for any support or you need to make the wider business aware of an issue you need to contact your manager. Any one of you should respond to the ticket, whether you are the primary on call or the secondary on call person. You need to create an alert for the responders to respond to the ticket, first priority should be the day shift guys who are working.
