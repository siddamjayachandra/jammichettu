Restarting the MySQL database

1. Check for the environment like aws,gcp,ibm - oneexiger.local will be in aws.
2. Login to the specific server using "ssh <server_name>". 
3. Check the memory using free -h . If free memory space is less then restart the mysql service.
4. Before doing that check the status of the service you can do this only as a root user. So, go to root by using sudo su and check the status "systemctl status MySQL".
5. Check the logs whether it is connection establishment failure or what.
6. Then restart the mysql service using "systemctl restart mysql" . It takes some time
7. Now go to argocd and sync the applications which have become down. Do the sync along with prune.
8. Once everything is synced and got healthy then msg to the concerned person to check.
